# WheelsOnRent
A Java-based application for seamless buying and selling of cars, connecting buyers and sellers through an interactive platform.
Run the WheelsOnRent.java file and it will give further instructions on how the app works for the user.
We have also implemented a login/sign-up system in this app where the passwords and username are stored in a separate file.
This was made as a part of the course project for Object Oriented Programming Course in the second semester.
